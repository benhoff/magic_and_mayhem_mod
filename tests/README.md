# Tests

Store automated checks and repeatable manual test protocols here. Each gameplay
experiment should state its clean baseline, single variable under test, expected
observation, and rollback procedure.

`./tests/test-tooling.sh` includes baseline integrity checks and the readable
route-request model. Run `./tests/test-reconstruction.sh` alone for the C++17
model with address/undefined-behavior sanitizers, or
`python3 tests/test-decompilation-baseline.py` for checksum/PE-byte verification
and tamper rejection. These are host/static tests, not live-game equivalence.
